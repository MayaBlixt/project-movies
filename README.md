# Movies App
A simple responsive movie app that displays movies fetched from themoviedb.org's API built with react components, props and useEffects. The detailed movie pages are dynamically created and link to using BrowserRoute and Route. The app was built with web accessibility in mind.

## The process
 My fourth project using React in the Technigo Bootcamp. I used a main component App where I used BrowserRoute and Route to link to diffrent pages such as MovieDetails, MovieList and NotFound. 

## Accessibility and cross-browser testing 

Html validated with W3C validation service (http://validator.w3.org/) with no errors found.
Chrome lighthouse report was generated with the result: 100% Accessibility, 100% Best Practices and 100% SEO. 
Accessibility checked with Wave chrome plugin and no errors raised and with screenreader chromeVox with no errors.
Testing has been done in different browsers such as Edge, FireFox and Chrome in mobile, tablet and desktop views.
